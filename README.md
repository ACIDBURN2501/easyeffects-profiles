# EasyEffects Output Profiles

This repository contains a personal collection of [EasyEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) output profiles for various headphones, IEMs, and monitoring setups. Backed up here for version control and portability.

## üéß Profiles

Each file in `output/` is a JSON profile exported directly from EasyEffects via:

```bash
~/.config/easyeffects/output/
```

### Available Profiles


- **EPZ Q1 Pro**
  Balanced Harman-style tuning for this budget planar IEM. Minor bass shelf boost with midrange and upper treble smoothing for fatigue-free listening.

- **FAAEAL Iris 2.0**
  Tailored to bring a more spacious sound signature to this warm, mid-focused earbud. Harman-style EQ applied to elevate treble clarity and sub-bass extension.

- **FAAEAL Rosemary**
  Warm IEMs adjusted for clarity ‚Äî profile enhances vocal presence and tightens bass, with subtle treble gain for sparkle without harshness.

- **Sennheiser HD 599**
  Open-back headphones with laid-back mids and rolled-off treble ‚Äî this profile adds sub-bass and upper treble correction for a more neutral Harman-like curve.

- **Koss Porta Pro**
  Classic warm bass-heavy signature ‚Äî EQ compensates with a reduction in mid-bass and a gentle lift in mids/treble to align with Harman tonality.

- **Koss Porta Pro (Yaxi)**
  Same as above but tuned for Yaxi pads, which alter the frequency response; adjustments focus on treble smoothness and slightly deeper sub-bass.

- **Tanchjim Zero**
  Already quite close to Harman out of the box ‚Äî minor EQ adjustments smooth the upper mids and correct for slight 8‚Äì10 kHz brightness depending on tips.

- **Virtuoso RGB**
  Gaming headset EQ‚Äôd for a more reference-style tonality ‚Äî midrange cleaned up for dialogue clarity, bass tamed slightly, and treble balanced to reduce fatigue during long sessions.
